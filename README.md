Program was created as a school project with the University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC). 

Requirements were to create a graphical user-interface 
that allowed deposits, withdraws, transfers, and balances.  

Input validation was checked for number input, 
positive values, $20 withdrawal increments, and fund availabilities. 

How to use:
Begin with depositing any amount into selected account.  
You may transfer funds between accounts, check balances, or 'withdraw' funds from specific accounts.
